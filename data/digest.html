      "detail": "UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili is set to defend his title for the fourth time in a rematch against No. 2-ranked Petr Yan at UFC 323, scheduled in Las Vegas on December 6. Their previous bout in March 2023 ended in a dominant unanimous decision win for Dvalishvili, where he outstruck Yan 147-75 and secured 11 takedowns. Since then, Dvalishvili, now on a UFC bantamweight record 13-fight win streak, has claimed the title in September 2024 and successfully defended it three times in 2025. He also holds the UFC record for most career takedowns with 117. Petr Yan remains a formidable opponent, having never been finished in his career and defeating top fighters like Song Yadong and Deiveson Figueiredo to earn this rematch. The co-main event features flyweight champion Alexandre Pantoja versus top contender Joshua Van. Pantoja holds the most wins and finishes in UFC flyweight history, while Van, at 24, aims to become the first UFC champion born after 2000.",

It suggests that consciousness arises as quantum information disperses into the environment and simultaneously integrates into coherent neural and cognitive patterns. The theory aligns with contemporary frameworks in neuroscience and philosophy, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP).<br><a href='https://prereview.org/preprints/doi-10.5281-zenodo.14984605' style='color:#00f0ff;'>source</a></div>

Georgiev — arXiv — 2025-04-13<br>This paper presents a quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of consciousness, identifying first-person subjective conscious states with unobservable quantum state vectors in the brain. It views the anatomically observable brain as a third-person objective construct created by classical bits of information obtained during the measurement of a subset of commuting quantum brain observables by the environment. The study implies that the quantum features of consciousness cannot be replicated by any classical physical device.<br><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18550' style='color:#00f0ff;'>source</a></div>

Zaghi — arXiv — 2024-12-08<br>This paper presents Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), a paradigm that re-envisions quantum theory and its interplay with spacetime, observers, and consciousness. RQD posits that observers, observed systems, and geometric structures emerge together as stable relational patterns in an underlying quantum substrate. The study unifies relational quantum mechanics, insights from holography and tensor networks, and non-dual philosophical traditions into a single idealist framework, revealing that quantum mechanics, gravity, and consciousness are facets of a single, integrated reality.<br><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979' style='color:#00f0ff;'>source</a></div>

It suggests that the causal openness of quantum systems provides self-conscious beings the ability to make independent choices and decisions, reflecting a sense of self-governance and autonomy.
